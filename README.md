## üí° Idea

```bash
$ egg tools add github.com/golangci/golangci-lint@latest

$ egg binary get github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser@latest
```

Full description of the idea is available [here][design.page].

## üèÜ Motivation

At [Avito](https://tech.avito.ru), we develop many services written on [Go](https://golang.org),
and many of them use different tools such as [easyjson](https://github.com/mailru/easyjson),
[goimports](https://github.com/kamilsk/go-tools/releases/tag/goimports),
[mockgen](https://github.com/golang/mock), and others. It isn't effortless to manage all of them
through all teams in the company.

For that reason, I need a tool that helps me to track tool dependencies for services,
interact with them, and manage scripts related to them (Makefile, activate script, etc).

## ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to

### egg deps

```bash
$ egg deps list
> github.com/izumin5210/gex
> github.com/spf13/cobra
> github.com/stretchr/testify
> go.octolab.org/toolkit/cli

$ egg deps check ...
```

### egg make

```bash
$ egg make build ...
```

### egg tools

```bash
$ mkdir tools && cd tools

# init a new toolset
$ go mod init your.module/tools
$ egg tools init

# add golangci-lint to tools.go
$ egg tools add github.com/golangci/golangci-lint
# add mockgen to tools.go and build it to bin/mockgen
$ egg tools add --build github.com/golang/mock/mockgen

# install tools to ${GOPATH}/bin
$ GOBIN="${GOPATH}/bin" go generate tools.go

# list the toolset
$ egg tools list
> mockgen
> golangci-lint
```

### egg vanity

```bash
$ egg vanity generate ...
```

## üß© Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
$ brew install kamilsk/tap/egg
```

### Binary

```bash
$ curl -sSfL https://bit.ly/install-chicken | sh
# or
$ wget -qO-  https://bit.ly/install-chicken | sh
```

### Source

```bash
# use standard go tools
$ go get -u github.com/kamilsk/egg
# or use egg tool
$ egg tools add github.com/kamilsk/egg

$ go mod edit -replace=github.com/izumin5210/gex=github.com/kamilsk/gex@latest
```

### Bash and Zsh completions

```bash
$ egg completion bash > /path/to/bash_completion.d/egg.sh
$ egg completion zsh  > /path/to/zsh-completions/_egg.zsh
```
